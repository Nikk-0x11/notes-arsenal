- second year: Development and Open Source Contributions

#### General Tips
- opensouce > CP
- development and opensource brings more oppurtunities
- CP rankings won't matter that much
- **FAANG AND CP IS NOT EVERYTHING!!!**
- development is a more safer path
- **DO WHAT YOU LIKE WHETHER IT'S CP OR DEVELOPMENT OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANNA DO JUST DO IT!**
- 3 - 4 hours of DSA and CP is more than enough.
