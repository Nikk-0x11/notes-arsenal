# Projects [CPP]

Projects are the best way to gain experience while learning. Here are some links and resources for CPP pet-projects

- [GSOC - Google Summer Of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive)
- [CPP - project based learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#cc)
- [Programming Challenges](https://programming-challenges.jeremyjaydan.dev/)

## Project Ideas List

### Games

- Snake
- Tetris
- Game of Life
- 15 puzzle
- Arkanoid
- Minesweeper
- 2048
- Solitaire
- Spider Solitaire
- Ping Pong
- Donkey Kong
- Labyrinth
- Network games for 2-4 players (ping-pong, tetris, chess, battleships, etc.)

### Applications

When creating an application, start with the simplest implementation of a console application. After each completed step, set a more complex task, for example: add a graphical interface for the application, teach the application to request data from the source using an http request, and then write/read the received data to a test file/database, etc. Do not forget about the principle: "from simple to complex."

- Network chat (raw sockets or using gRPC)
- Calculator
- File Manager
- Currency Converter
- Getting a list of "Pull-Requests" or "Issues" in any Github repository
- Routine automation: various calculations and generation of reports in the form of tables

### Student Applications

The following examples are more suitable for students who are passing or recently passed basic disciplines: linear algebra, analytical geometry, mathematical analysis, physics, etc. Tasks for the application of the studied theory will help to simultaneously "catch two birds with one stone": to consolidate the studied theory in practice and to practice programming. This path is not closed to others, but it is obviously easier for students, because knowledge of academic disciplines is still fresh.

- Linear algebra library: matrices, vectors, calculations, etc.
- Modeling of various processes: physics, theoretical mechanics, etc.
- Application of numerical methods: integration, differentiation, approximation, interpolation, etc.
