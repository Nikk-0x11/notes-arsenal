## Reverse engineering Roadmap

1. Learn c / c++ / python (this will come handy)
2. Learn assembly
3. Start decompiling programs in disassemblers
4. start solving crackmes (you will learn most of the reverse engineering here, start with easy crackmes, don't be afraid to look at tutorials and write-ups or even ask proper detailed questions to us)
4. Start competing in CTF's and other competitions and find teammates who will contribute to your skill development.

#### Resources
Go through each link and make notes if possible when you do a course, read books, solve reversing challenges and samples.
