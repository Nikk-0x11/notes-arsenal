# My notes ~~storage~~ arsenal 
 ### A repo with all of my notes...

- **CTFs** -> files and solution of CTF challenges that I solved recently.
- **compe_programming** -> competitive problems answer.
- **DSA** -> DSA notes
- **guides** -> guides on different stuff.
- **langs** -> programming languages reference notes.

> Am too lazy and can't google stuff again and again so I just copy/paste them into a file and dump them here with some add-ons and easy to understand explanation. :D
