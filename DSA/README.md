## More thoughts on learning DSA

- Data Structures are the ultimate basis for a programmer.
- An engineer who has a good understanding of algorithms and data structures can make thoughtful choices and write programs that can handle changes better and perform well.
- Don’t be afraid of the mathematical part.
- DSA does involve some mathematical reasoning and proof, especially when analyzing the time and space complexity of an algorithm.
- The Big-O complexity is important, but you don’t need to worry about it too much. You don’t need a high IQ and abstract mathematical knowledge.
- DSA is storage for a set of data, an algorithm is a method and pattern for solving problems.
- Data Structures and Algorithms complete each other. The data structure is for the algorithm, the algorithm is applied to a specific data structure. That’s why we can’t isolate Data Structure and Algorithms.

**Basic topics**

```
array, linked list, stack, queue, hash table, map, heap, binary tree, trie tree, graph, skip list
```

**Advanced topics**

```
sorting, binary search, search, string matching, recursion, hash algorithm, greedy algorithm, divide and conquer algorithm, backtracking algorithm, dynamic programming
```

- Don’t remember topics cuz you’ll forget them after some time, Implied ideas in algorithms are more important than details.
